# Urban Temple
An online martial arts education platform based on video feedbacks. Nearly all online education platforms are purely one way communications, especially in physical activities. We merely obeserve a video and are expected to immitate, a "monkey see, monkey do" system. 

Urban Temple follows the strict progression system of traditional martial arts schools. Student are only able to view content approrpriate to their level, this is done my a progression system of ranks. Once a student believes themselves ready, or wish for proper feedback from their instructor, they may submit a link to a video they uploaded (like Youtube) of their performance. 

This is where our feedback system works, the instructor, after reviewing the student's video will determine if he/she is ready to advance in rank, unlocking content of that rank. Of schools with multiple disciplines, each student will have their own unique rank and progress in each discipline. This process will repeat until the student has reach the highest rank.
